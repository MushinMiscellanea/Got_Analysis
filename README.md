# Sentiment Analysis on Game of Thrones Dialogue

My final project for LIS 4761 Data Mining. I used NLTK through Orange Data mining to generate sentiment scores for all Game of Thrones (T.V.) dialogue. I then filtered for lines regarding main characters to find the general sentiment of people from the known world toward Jon, Cersei, and Dany.

#### I am sorry my code is so terribly undocumented. I will be completing this in the coming months, and it will be marvelous 

## Start

The analysis was done in a stand alone software called Orange Data Mining.
The visualization was done in Jupyter Notebook using python visualization liberaries.

### Installations


```
brew install python  

pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn

```

### Installing

Setup a virtual env if that's what you are into
```
pip install pipenv

pipenv install jupyter pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn
```
